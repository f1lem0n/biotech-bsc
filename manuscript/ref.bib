    abstract = {It is well established that some reduced fermentation products or microbially reduced artificial mediators can abiotically react with electrodes to yield a small electrical current. This type of metabolism does not typically result in an efficient conversion of organic compounds to electricity because only some metabolic end products will react with electrodes, and the microorganisms only incompletely oxidize their organic fuels. A new form of microbial respiration has recently been discovered in which microorganisms conserve energy to support growth by oxidizing organic compounds to carbon dioxide with direct quantitative electron transfer to electrodes. These organisms, termed electricigens, offer the possibility of efficiently converting organic compounds into electricity in self-sustaining systems with long-term stability. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

The separator, an important part of METs that greatly affects the latter's performance, is commonly made of Nafion proton exchange membrane (PEM). However, many problems have been identified associated with the Nafion PEM such as high cost of membrane, significant oxygen and substrate crossovers, and transport of cations other than protons protons and biofouling. A variety of materials have been offered as alternative separators such as ion-exchange membranes, salt bridges, glass fibers, composite membranes and porous materials. It has been claimed that low cost porous materials perform better than PEM. These include J-cloth, nylon filter, glass fiber mat, non-woven cloth, earthen pot and ceramics that enable non-ion selective charge transfer.

This review addresses the factors that are essential for practical application of BESs. First, we compare benefits (value of products and cleaning of wastewater) with costs (capital and operational costs). Based on this, we analyze the maximum internal resistance (in m$\omega$ m2) and current density that is required to make microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and hydrogen-producing microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) cost effective. We compare these maximum resistances to reported internal resistances and current densities with special focus on cathodic resistances. Whereas the current densities of MFCs still need to be increased considerably (i.e., internal resistance needs to be decreased), MECs are closer to application as their current densities can be increased by increasing the applied voltage. For MFCs, the production of high-value products in combination with electricity production and wastewater treatment is a promising route. {\textcopyright} 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy via oxidation-reduction reactions is dependent on the performance (and efficiency) of the anode and cathode materials used in the fuel cell. In the past few years, the significance of the electrode material has been recognized from various research studies aimed to improve its performance and efficiency of fuel cells. In this review paper, various developments in electrode materials for microbial fuel cells (MFC) are discussed. In this application, modification of anode material to seek compatibility with microorganisms is a major concern for the enhancement of the power generation. To this end, various strategies have been discussed in detail to effectively enhance MFC properties. This paper focuses on the role of different nanomaterials and their composites as electrode materials (with a major emphasis on anode application) in MFCs based on the evaluation of their performance in relation to their properties. Further promising pathways for the future research in this area have been identified and discussed.},

    abstract = {Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in municipal wastewater treatment plants (M-WWTPs) have garnered increasing interest in terms of attaining energy self-sufficiency due to their theoretical superiority to conventional M-WWTP processes. Despite being widely studied, pertaining literature primarily focuses on the fundamentals and configurations of the MFCs while overlooking their targeted application niche. Therefore, the adoption of MFCs in many niches (i.e., M-WWTPs) has not been adequately reviewed yet. This study aims to critically review the adoption of MFCs for carbon handling in the liquid stream of M-WWTPs with an emphasis on MFC's scalability, use of municipal wastewater (M-WW) as the substrate, and MFC's capital cost. The review includes the scaled-up results and other efforts to engineer MFCs. Three key challenges stymie MFC's adoption in M-WWTPs: low power generation, wide range of reported carbon removal efficiencies, and high capital cost. Accordingly, MFCs should be adopted in M-WWTPs with the goal of energy neutrality, not extra electricity production. To meet the effluent discharge standards, MFCs should be preceded by primary treatment, followed by an anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactor. However, breakthroughs are still required to make this technology cost-efficient and energy-efficient. These efforts should take into consideration the multivariate nature of the MFCs. Additionally, the development of bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic technologies has shown great prominence as an alternative technology that can be integrated into M-WWTPs. However, validation based on larger-scale applications, cost, and energy estimations is still needed.},

Secondly, the development of the concept of microbial fuel cell into a wider range of derivative technologies, called bioelectrochemical systems, is described introducing briefly microbial electrolysis cells, microbial desalination cells and microbial electrosynthesis cells. The focus is then shifted to electroactive biofilms and electron transfer mechanisms involved with solid electrodes. Carbonaceous and metallic anode materials are then introduced, followed by an explanation of the electro catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction and its behavior in neutral media, from recent studies. Cathode catalysts based on carbonaceous, platinum-group metal and platinum-group-metal-free materials are presented, along with membrane materials with a view to future directions. Finally, microbial fuel cell practical implementation, through the utilization of energy output for practical applications, is described.},

@article{Potter1911,
    abstract = { The results of recent researches in electro-physiology have familiarised us with the view that any physiological process accompanied by chemical changes involves an associated electrical change. Haacke and Klein have shown that electrical currents in plants are essentially a manifestation of vital phenomena, and that differences in electric potential are connected both with respiration and carbon assimilation. Waller's investigations have also shown that the excitation of living vegetable protoplasm gives electrical response no less than that of animal protoplasm. He has demonstrated that leaves in a condition of active metabolism give an instant electrical response to the influence of sunlight, which was modified under conditions affecting protoplasmic activity. Apparently almost immediately upon the perception of the stimulus of light, electrical energy begins to be absorbed in the process of photosynthesis. Waller approaches very suggestively the existence of two opposing forces in the presence of analytic and synthetic processes, and recognises that the function of assimilation and respiration might be mutually antagonistic as regards visible electric effects. His conception that "the product of dissociation {\ldots}. gives current from the focus of dissociation, whereas a product of association, during its formation, gives rise to a current in the opposite direction," is of great interest. The line of enquiry now followed lies in the direction only of dissociation, and is a study of electrical effects accompanying fermentation or putrefaction under the influence of micro-organisms such as Saccharomyces or bacteria. The special physiological character of fungi or bacteria demands the disintegration of organic compounds as a necessary source of energy, and where there has been absorption of energy in a synthetic process one must look for its liberation when the change is of an analytic nature. The evolution of caloric energy during fermentation or putrefaction is commonly recognised, and that electrical energy is also liberated during these processes is a conception of considerable interest. In this preliminary communication some experiments are described which were undertaken to determine whether any E. M. F. is developed when organic compounds are broken down through the fermentative activity of yeast and other organisms. Cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisi{\ae} and certain species of bacteria were grown in nutrient media, and the chemical action of their vital processes was utilised to develop electrical energy in a manner parallel to the production of E. M. F. by means of the ordinary galvanic cell. },

One key assessment that clearly establishes whether one technology can fully enter the market is the profitability demonstration. For this demonstration, classical evaluation criteria for investment decisions such as the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return can be applied to a given proposal. This paper presents an economic assessment of a microbial fuel cell in a juice processing plant. Three different scenarios, optimistic, pessimistic and most likely scenarios based on the maximum power density of the cell on two basic MFC cases (cathodes with and without Pt, respectively), were studied and compared to the conventional activated sludge process. The results show that under most of the scenarios under consideration, including the pessimistic one, MFC is a more attractive option. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed with respect to the electrode area, and the annual growth rate of the electricity pricing has revealed that the electrode area parameter is the most influential, reducing the MFC profitability for larger electrode areas, whereas the higher the annual growth rates of the electricity price, the higher the MFC profits. In summary, the results of this study show that the implementation of MFC is a promising alternative to the use of classical aerated activated sludge, and it has potential economic benefits.},

In model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 we have heterologously expressed Sphingopyxis sp. USTB-05 microcystinase (MlrA) bearing a 23 amino acid N-terminus secretion peptide from native Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PilA (sll1694). The resultant whole cell biocatalyst displayed about 3 times higher activity against microcystin-LR compared to a native MlrA host (Sphingomonas sp. ACM 3962), normalized for optical density. In addition, MlrA activity was found to be almost entirely located in the cyanobacterial cytosolic fraction, despite the presence of the secretion tag, with crude cellular extracts showing MlrA activity comparable to extracts from MlrA expressing E. coli. Furthermore, despite approximately 9.4-fold higher initial MlrA activity of a whole cell E. coli biocatalyst, utilization of a photoautotrophic chassis resulted in prolonged stability of MlrA activity when cultured under semi-natural conditions (using lake water), with the heterologous MlrA biocatalytic activity of the E. coli culture disappearing after 4 days, while the cyanobacterial host displayed activity (3% of initial activity) after 9 days. In addition, the cyanobacterial cell density was maintained over the duration of this experiment while the cell density of the E. coli culture rapidly declined. Lastly, failure to establish a stable cyanobacterial isolate expressing native MlrA (without the N-terminus tag) via the strong cpcB560 promoter draws attention to the use of peptide tags to positively modulate expression of potentially toxic proteins. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 overexpressing MlrA has shown about 3-fold higher whole-cell microcystin-detoxifying activity than natural MlrA gene host Sphingomonas sp. ACM 3962.},

Furthermore, MlrA and the MlrABC degradation pathway are presently the only enzymatic processes with clear genetic and biochemical descriptions available for microcystins degradation, greatly facilitating modern applied genetics for any relevant technological development. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the potential of sustainable, biologically inspired alternatives to current industrial practice, with note that biological microcystins degradation is the primary detoxification process found in nature. While previous reviews have broadly discussed microbial biodegradation processes, here we present a review focused specifically on MlrA. Following a general overview, we briefly highlight the initial discovery and present understanding of the MlrABC degradation pathway, before discussing the genetic and biochemical aspects of MlrA. We then review the potential biotechnology applications of MlrA in the context of available literature with emphasis on the optimization of MlrA for in situ applications including (i) direct modulation of Mlr activity within naturally existing populations, (ii) bioaugmentation of systems with introduced biodegradative capacity via whole cell biocatalysts, and (iii) bioremediation via direct MlrA application.},

    abstract = "Sinice są grupą organizmów prokariotycznych o szerokim zasięgu występowania, zdolnymi do przeprowadzania procesu fotosyntezy tlenowej w wyniku której uzyskują energię oraz substancje potrzebne im do wzrostu. Organizmy te są również odpowiedzialne za wytwarzanie dużej ilości metabolitów wtórnych, z których część (m.in. MC-LR) wykazuje działanie toksyczne. Pierwszym celem niniejszej pracy było porównanie aktywności konstruktów Synechocystis PCC 6803_cpcB_mlrA oraz Synechocystis PCC 6803_trc_mlrA wobec toksyny MC-LR produkowanej przez niektóre szczepy sinic do których należy m.in. Microcystis aeruginosa. Porównanie zostało dokonane poprzez zbadanie aktywności białka MlrA wytwarzanego przez oba mutanty przez okres 28 dni eksperymentu. Wykazano, że aktywność MlrA w konstrukcie mlrA z promotorem cpcB jest na bardzo podobnym poziomie co w przypadku konstruktu mlrA z promotorem trc oraz spada w czasie trwania eksperymentu. Następnie zbadano długotrwałą aktywność liofilizatów MlrA uzyskanych z ekstraktów modyfikowanych szczepów (Synechocystis PCC 6803_cpcB_mlrA, Synechocystis PCC 6803_trc_mlrA oraz Escherichia coli C41_pET21a_mlrA) które były przechowywane w różnych temperaturach: -20 °C, 4°C, 20 °C. Podczas tego eksperymentu wykazano, że przechowywane w temperaturze -20 °C oraz 4 °C liofilizaty lizatów MlrA wykazują dużą stabilność i białko MlrA zachowuje swoją  początkową aktywność przez cały okres trwania eksperymentu. Liofilizat MlrA przechowywany w temperaturze 20 °C charakteryzował się gwałtownym spadkiem aktywności białka MlrA w odstępie pierwszych 10 tygodni eksperymentu po czym aktywność MlrA ustabilizowała się na niskim poziomie, aż do czasu zakończenia eksperymentu. W kolejnej części zbadano produkcje MlrA w konstruktach Synechocystis PCC 6803 zawierających gen mlrA dostarczonych z McCormick Lab z Uniwersytetu w Edynburgu. Wykazano aktywność białka MlrA w lizatach kilku konstruktów, uzyskancyh po przeprowadzeniu procesu homogenizacji danych hodowli. W ostatniej części pracy przygotowano w procesie transformacji zmutowane genetycznie komórki Escherichia coli TOP10 zawierające 3 plazmidy: plazmid z McCormick Lab, pRL443 oraz pRL623, które następnie wykorzystano podczas przeprowadzenia procesu koniugacji z komórkami Synechococcus UTEX 2973 w celu wytworzenia nowych zmutowanych genetycznie szczepów., Cyanobacteria are a group of prokaryotic organisms with the wide range of occurance, capable of carrying out the process of oxygen photosynthesis, as a result of which they obtain the energy and substances needed to growth. These organisms are also responsible for the production of large amounts of secondary metabolites, some of which (including MC-LR) are toxic. The first aim of this work was to compare the activity of Synechocystis PCC 6803_cpcB_mlrA and Synechocystis PCC 6803_trc_mlrA against hepatotoxic MC-LR produced by some strains of cyanobacteria, including Microcystis aeruginosa. It has been shown that the long term activity of MlrA in the construct containing the cpcB promoter is at very similar level as in the construct with the trc promoter and decreases during the experiment. In the next step the long-term activity of MlrA lyophilisates prepared from three different hosts (Synechocystis PCC 6803_cpcB_mlrA, Synehocystis PCC 6803_trc_mlrA and Escherichia coli C41_pET21a_mlrA), stored at three different temperatures (-20 °C, 4 °C and 20 °C) was tested. It has been documented that the lyophilizate stored at -20 °C and 4 °C are highly stable and the MlrA protein retains its initial activity over the entire duration of the experiment. The MlrA lyophilisate stored at 20 °C showed the rapid decrease in the activity of MlrA protein within the first 10 weeks of the experiment. Then, the activity of MlrA protein stabilized at a low level until the end of the experiment. The next part of this work was focused on testing the Synechocystis PCC 6803 constructs containing the mlrA gene provided from McCormick Lab of the Univeristy of Edinburgh. We demonstrated the activity of MlrA protein in some cell lysates, created after the homogenization process. In the last part of this work, genetically modified Escherichia coli TOP10 cells containing 3 plasmids (plasmid from McCormick Lab, plasmid pRL443 and plasmid pL623) were prepared during the transformation process. Then, these cells were used in the conjugation process with Synechococcus UTEX 2973 cells to generate new genetically modified strains.",
